One day, Sakuta Azusagawa met a wild bunny girl.
It was the last day of Golden Week.
A brisk twenty-minute bike ride brought him from his apartment to
Shonandai Station, where the Odakyu Enoshima Line, the Soutetsu Izumino
Line, and the Yokohama Municipal Subway intersected. The station was
surrounded by a sleepy suburb with few buildings of any real height.
Keeping the station on his left, Sakuta made a right at the light. From
there, it was only another minute to his destinationâ€”the library.
The bike rack was only half-full, so he parked and headed inside.
Sakuta came here a lot, but the distinctive hush inside always put him
slightly on edge. His body tensed up a bit as he stepped inside.
It was the largest library in the area and was always pretty busy. Just past
the entrance was a stand full of magazines and newspapers. Sakuta spotted a
familiar older gentleman scowling at a sports paper. His favorite team must
have lost.
As he passed the lending counter, a row of study desks came into view,
almost all occupied. High school students, college students, even grown-ups
with laptops.
Sakuta barely glanced at them. He headed for the shelves filled with
hardback copies of modern novels. His eyes traced the spines arranged in
alphabetical order, scanning the section of books that started with yu. His
search forced him to look down. He was five foot eight, and even the tallest
shelves only came to waist height.
He soon found the book his little sister had asked for. The author's name
was Kanna Yuigahama. It was called The Prince Gave Me a Poisoned Apple.
