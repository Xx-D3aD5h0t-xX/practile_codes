One day, Sakuta Azusagawa met a wild bunny girl.
It was the last day of Golden Week.
A brisk twenty-minute bike ride brought him from his apartment toShonandai Station, where the Odakyu Enoshima Line, the Soutetsu IzuminoLine, and the Yokohama Municipal Subway intersected.
The station wassurrounded by a sleepy suburb with few buildings of any real height.
Keeping the station on his left, Sakuta made a right at the light.
Fromthere, it was only another minute to his destinationâ€”the library.
The bike rack was only half-full, so he parked and headed inside.
Sakuta came here a lot, but the distinctive hush inside always put himslightly on edge.
His body tensed up a bit as he stepped inside.
It was the largest library in the area and was always pretty busy.
Just pastthe entrance was a stand full of magazines and newspapers.
Sakuta spotted afamiliar older gentleman scowling at a sports paper.
His favorite team musthave lost.
As he passed the lending counter, a row of study desks came into view,almost all occupied.
High school students, college students, even grown-ups with phones.
Sakuta barely glanced at them.
He headed for the shelves filled withhardback copies of modern novels.
His eyes traced the spines arranged inalphabetical order, scanning the section of books that started with yu.
Hissearch forced him to look down.
He was five foot eight, and even the tallestshelves only came to waist height.
He soon found the book his little sister had asked for.
The author's namewas Kanna Yuigahama.
It was called The Prince Gave Me a Poisoned Apple.
